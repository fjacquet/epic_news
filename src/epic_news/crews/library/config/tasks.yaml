    CRITICAL: Use the ReportingTool to generate a comprehensive, professional HTML report 
    about the topic: {topic}. The ReportingTool will ensure proper template usage and 
    complete, non-truncated output that follows project standards.
    
    Review all research findings and create a complete, well-structured HTML report with:
    - Full content (never truncated or incomplete)
    - Professional formatting using proper templates
    - Clear headings, bullet points, and structure
    - Table of contents and emojis for section headings
    - UTF-8 encoding for emoji support
    - All project design standards for HTML reports
    
    IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the ReportingTool to generate the final HTML output. 
    Do not write HTML directly - let the ReportingTool handle template application.
  expected_output: >
    A single, complete, valid HTML file containing the full professional report 
    generated using the ReportingTool. The HTML must be complete (not truncated), 
    well-formatted, styled according to project templates, and ready for publication 
    or PDF conversion. No placeholder text or incomplete sections allowed.
