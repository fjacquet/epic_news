    CRITICAL: Generate a comprehensive, professional book report in Markdown format
    about the topic: {topic}. The report should be well-structured and ready to be
    rendered using the universal template system.
    Create a complete, well-structured Markdown report with:
    - Clear, hierarchical headings (##,  ###, etc.)
    - Bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate
    - Proper formatting for book titles, author names, and key concepts
    - Emojis for section headings to enhance readability
    - Any relevant quotes or excerpts properly formatted as blockquotes
    IMPORTANT: Focus on generating high-quality Markdown content only.
    Do not include HTML tags or worry about styling - that will be handled by the template.
  expected_output: |
    A complete Markdown document containing the full book report with:
    - Title and author information
    - Summary/Overview section
    - Key themes and analysis
    - Important quotes/excerpts (properly formatted)
    - Personal insights or recommendations
    - No HTML tags or styling - just clean Markdown content
