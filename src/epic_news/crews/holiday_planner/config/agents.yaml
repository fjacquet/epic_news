content_formatter:

    guide. Ensure the guide is not just a data dump, but a well-structured,
    engaging narrative that directly addresses all aspects of the user's request.
    If any information from prior tasks seems incomplete or missing (e.g., specific
    hotel bookings not finalized, unclear details on an activity), clearly
    acknowledge this in the guide and provide helpful next steps or general advice
    for the user based on the available research. The final output must be
    professional, visually appealing with excellent HTML formatting, easy to
    navigate, and directly usable by the traveler. Translate the entire guide into
    French as requested, maintaining accuracy, tone, and cultural nuances. Save a
    final summary of the created guide's key points to RAG for archival purposes.
    Use web search tools (e.g., SerperDevTool) sparingly and only for minor
