    MANDATORY: Analyze EVERY SINGLE stock ticker in the stock portfolio CSV file located at: {stock_csv_path}
    
    STEP 1: Use FileReadTool to read the CSV file at the exact path: {stock_csv_path}
    The CSV file contains columns: Name, Ticker, Currency. Read the COMPLETE file,
    count the total number of entries, and analyze ALL of them without exception.
    
    STEP 2: For EACH ticker in the "Ticker" column, extract the actual ticker symbol 
    (remove "Yahoo:" prefix if present) and use your available tools to research 
    the latest news and market sentiment. 
    
    STEP 3: Based on your findings, provide a clear recommendation: BUY, SELL, or KEEP. 
    Include a concise one-sentence justification for each recommendation. 
    
    The portfolio contains 60+ stocks - analyze ALL of them.
    Your output MUST include every single stock from the CSV file.
    
    IMPORTANT: The file path is provided as {stock_csv_path} - use this EXACT path with FileReadTool.
  expected_output: >
    A structured report in Markdown format containing the analysis for EVERY SINGLE
    stock ticker in the CSV file (60+ entries expected). NO SAMPLING, NO SHORTCUTS.
    Example format for EACH stock: 
    - "**AAPL (Apple Inc.):** KEEP - Recent product announcements show strong innovation, but market is saturated." 
    - "**TSLA (Tesla, Inc.):** SELL - Increased competition and production hurdles pose significant risks."
    Your report MUST contain 60+ individual stock analyses.

    MANDATORY: Use KrakenAssetListTool to get the COMPLETE list of crypto assets and analyze EVERY SINGLE ONE.
    The tool automatically reads KRAKEN_API_KEY and KRAKEN_API_SECRET from environment variables.
    Call KrakenAssetListTool with only the asset_class parameter (use "currency").
    
    If the environment variables are not set or the API call fails, the tool will return an error message - 
    REPORT THE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE transparently in your output.
    For EACH token returned by KrakenAssetListTool, use BOTH YahooFinanceNewsTool AND KrakenTickerInfoTool 
    to fetch comprehensive market data. Based on your analysis, provide a clear recommendation: BUY, SELL, or KEEP.
    Include a concise one-sentence justification for each recommendation.
    You MUST analyze ALL crypto holdings - no exceptions, no shortcuts, no silent fallbacks.
  expected_output: >
    A structured report in Markdown format containing the analysis for EVERY SINGLE crypto asset from Kraken.
    If KrakenAssetListTool fails, include the exact error details at the top of your report.
    Example format for EACH crypto: 
    - "**ADA.S (Cardano):** BUY - Strong institutional adoption and upcoming protocol upgrades are positive catalysts." 
    - "**ETH.F (Ethereum):** KEEP - Network activity is high, but recent gas fee volatility warrants caution."
    If Kraken fails: "**KRAKEN API ERROR:** [exact error message] - Unable to retrieve crypto portfolio."
    Your report MUST contain analysis for ALL available crypto holdings or transparent error reporting.

    MANDATORY: Review the COMPLETE stock portfolio analysis from the context and identify ALL current stock holdings
    from the CSV file (extract ticker symbols from the "Ticker" column, removing "Yahoo:" prefix).
    Create a comprehensive list of ALL 60+ current holdings first. Then, use your financial research tools to 
    identify 2-3 promising stock investment opportunities that are DEFINITELY NOT in the current portfolio.
    You MUST cross-check each suggestion against the complete holdings list to avoid duplicates.
    Focus on stocks or ETFs that would complement the existing portfolio. Provide detailed recommendations
    including ticker symbols and compelling explanations for why they are good BUY opportunities right now.
  expected_output: >
    A structured report in Markdown format with new stock recommendations that are VERIFIED to not be
    in the current portfolio. Must include a section listing current holdings for verification.
    Example: "**Current Holdings Verified:** [List of all 60+ current tickers]
    **New Stock Recommendations:**
    - **VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF):** This ETF offers broad exposure
     to the entire U.S. stock market, making it an excellent core holding for diversification. 
     Given the current portfolio's concentration in specific tech stocks, 
     VTI would reduce risk and capture growth across all sectors.
    - **JPM (JPMorgan Chase & Co.):** A defensive financial play with consistent dividends and 
    strong fundamentals, providing stability during market volatility."
