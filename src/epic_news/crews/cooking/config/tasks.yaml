    Create a complete, authentic recipe for {topic}.
    Your task is to:
    1. RESEARCH: Find the most authentic and highly-rated recipe for {topic}.
    2. PREPARE CONTENT: Write a compelling title and a detailed recipe body in HTML format. 
    The body should include:
       - An introduction to the recipe.
       - A well-organized ingredient list (e.g., using <ul> and <li>).
       - Clear, step-by-step instructions (e.g., using <ol> and <li>).
       - Note which steps are optimized for Thermomix.
       - Serving suggestions and yield information.
    3. GENERATE REPORT: Use the ReportingTool to create the final, professional HTML report. 
    Pass the title, the HTML body you created, and the output file path 'output/cooking/recipe.html' to the tool.

    IMPORTANT:
    - The recipe MUST be written in French.
    - Use appropriate emojis throughout to enhance readability.
    - The HTML body you create should be well-structured but does NOT need the `<html>` or `<body>` tags, as the ReportingTool will add them.
  expected_output: >
    A professional HTML report file generated by the ReportingTool, containing the complete recipe in French.
    The report should be well-structured with a title, introduction, ingredients, and instructions.
    The ReportingTool will handle saving the file with proper styling and formatting.
