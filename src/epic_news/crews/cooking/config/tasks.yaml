html_recipe_task:
  description: |
    Create a complete, authentic, and professionally styled HTML recipe for {topic}, with Thermomix optimization when appropriate.
    Your task includes:
    1. RESEARCH: Find the most authentic and highly-rated recipe for {topic}.
    2. CONTENT: Create a complete ingredient list, clear step-by-step instructions, serving suggestions, and yield information.
    3. THERMOMIX: Clearly note which steps are optimized for Thermomix.
    4. STYLING: The final output MUST be a single HTML file with inline CSS for a professional, modern, and visually appealing presentation.
       - Use a clean and readable font family (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif).
       - Implement a pleasing color scheme. Consider a light background with dark text for readability.
       - Ensure proper spacing and layout for all elements (headings, paragraphs, lists).
       - Style headings (h1, h2, h3) consistently.
       - Make lists (ul, ol) easy to read.
       - Optionally, use subtle borders or background colors to differentiate sections.

    IMPORTANT:
    - The output MUST be ONLY the raw HTML content, starting with '<!DOCTYPE html>' or '<html>' and ending with '</html>'.
    - Do NOT include any markdown, introductory text, or explanations outside of the HTML tags.
    - The recipe MUST be written in French.
    - Use appropriate emojis throughout to enhance readability (e.g., üçÜ, üçÖ, ‚è±Ô∏è).
    - Do not output placeholder text; provide the actual recipe content.
  expected_output: |
    A single, complete HTML file (recipe.html) containing a professionally styled recipe in French. The HTML must include inline CSS for a modern, visually appealing, and easy-to-read layout. The recipe should feature:
    1. Recipe title and a brief, engaging introduction (with authenticity context if applicable).
    2. A well-organized ingredient list with precise measurements.
    3. Step-by-step preparation instructions, clearly indicating Thermomix steps (with settings) versus manual steps.
    4. Details on timing, temperature, and equipment.
    5. Serving suggestions and presentation tips.
    6. The original URL of the base recipe if sourced from the internet.
    The entire output must be valid HTML with inline CSS, ready for direct viewing in a browser.

    Convert the provided recipe (from context) into a YAML format compatible with the Paprika 3 app. The recipe MUST be in French.

    - Start directly with the first YAML key (e.g., 'name:').
    - End directly with the last value of the last key.
    - Do NOT include ANY introductory text, concluding text, explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting (like ```yaml) around the YAML block.
    - The entire output string must be parsable as valid YAML.
  expected_output: |
    A single, complete, and valid YAML string representing the recipe, formatted for Paprika 3. This string must be directly parsable as YAML without any modifications.

    All textual content within the YAML (e.g., values for 'notes', 'ingredients', 'directions') MUST be in French.
    Example of a VALID start: "name: Recette Exemple"
    Example of an INVALID start: "Okay, here is the YAML: ```yaml\nname: Recette Exemple"
