# Objective: Integrate a new DeepResearchCrew into the global main.py flow to conduct in-depth research on user-provided topics

This integration requires a thorough impact analysis and a detailed technical specification, designed strictly in alignment with the CrewAI flow framework spirit for optimal orchestration and collaboration.

Crew Definition: @DeepResearchCrew

This crew will function as a specialized team of autonomous agents, collaboratively responsible for:

Information Gathering (Action: DEEPRESEARCH):

Extensive Internet Search: Agents will perform broad and deep internet searches to gather the most current and comprehensive information on a user-provided topic.

Specialized Tool Utilization: Agents will strategically utilize tools specified in @2_TOOLS_HANDBOOK.md, including but not limited to Wikipedia tools, to maximize research depth and accuracy. The design of these tools within @agents.yaml will be brief and precise, granting only necessary capabilities to each agent.

Report Generation:

Structured Content: The collected information will be synthesized into a detailed report, strictly adhering to the guidelines in @1_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md and @3_ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS.md.

Pydantic Object Creation: The report content will be programmatically structured as a Pydantic object to ensure data consistency and facilitate seamless downstream processing.

High-Quality HTML Rendering: This Pydantic object will then be injected into our existing HTML templating system for a high-quality, user-friendly visual presentation.

Distribution:

Automated Email Delivery: The final rendered report will be sent via email using the @PostCrew, following established communication protocols.

Localization: The report content will be delivered in French, taking @FinDailyCrew as an exemplary reference for a well-architectured, localized crew output.

CrewAI Framework Alignment & Technical Considerations:

To ensure this integration fully embodies the CrewAI spirit, the following aspects are paramount:

Global Integration & Flow Orchestration: The DeepResearchCrew will be seamlessly injected into the global @main.py flow. The impact analysis must detail how this new crew will interact with existing system components and contribute to the overall workflow.

Autonomous Agent Design & Collaboration: Design the DeepResearchCrew as a team of specialized agents, each with clearly defined roles and tasks that promote collaboration rather than isolated execution.

Asynchronous Execution: Prioritize async_execution: true for the DeepResearchCrew to ensure non-blocking operations and maintain system responsiveness, leveraging CrewAI's concurrency capabilities.

State Management & Data Flow: Critically review @content_state.py to understand how DeepResearchCrew will read from and write to the shared state, ensuring data consistency and continuity across the entire workflow.

Robustness & Error Handling: The technical specification must detail mechanisms for handling research failures, tool errors, and incomplete data, ensuring the crew's resilience.

Codebase & Documentation Adherence: Leverage @docs and the complete codebase for foundational understanding. Review @main.py to understand the full impact of this new crew's integration.

Brief Agent Tooling: As a core CrewAI principle, @agents.yaml must define tools for agents in a concise manner, only granting what's strictly necessary for their specific roles.

Deliverables:

Please provide a complete impact analysis and a detailed technical specification for this DeepResearchCrew integration. Your response should include:

A clear, step-by-step reasoning process for all proposed architectural and implementation choices.

Specific code modification recommendations for @main.py, @content_state.py, and @agents.yaml.

Considerations for scalability, performance optimization, and error recovery within the CrewAI framework.

Action Item: Keep @TODO.md updated with progress and identified tasks throughout this analysis and specification process.
