### 2. Full Pydantic Model & Directory Refactoring

*This is a comprehensive refactoring to improve modularity, reliability, and data quality across the application. It involves relocating all crew-specific Pydantic models to a dedicated directory and then refactoring five key OSINT crews to use structured outputs.*

-   [x] **Phase 1: Create New Model Structure**
    -   [x] Create the new directory: `src/epic_news/models/crews/`.
    -   [x] **Move existing crew-specific models** to the new directory and rename where necessary.
    -   [x] **Create the 5 new OSINT report model files** in the new directory.

-   [x] **Phase 2: Create Model Tests**
    -   [x] Create and validate tests for all new and relocated models.

-   [x] **Phase 3: Update All Project Import Paths & Fix Tests**
    -   [x] Update all import statements in the project to point to the new model locations.
    -   [x] Run the full test suite and fix all resulting errors.

-   [x] **Phase 4: Refactor `CompanyProfilerCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure `company_reporter` agent in `agents.yaml` has `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `company_profiler_crew.py`, import `CompanyProfileReport` and add `output_pydantic=CompanyProfileReport` to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the crew and `uv run pytest`.

-   [x] **Phase 5: Refactor `CrossReferenceReportCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure `osint_reporter` agent in `agents.yaml` has `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `cross_reference_report_crew.py`, import `CrossReferenceReport` and add `output_pydantic=CrossReferenceReport` to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the crew and `uv run pytest`.

-   [x] **Phase 6: Refactor `GeospatialAnalysisCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure `geospatial_reporter` agent in `agents.yaml` has `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `geospatial_analysis_crew.py`, import `GeospatialAnalysisReport` and add `output_pydantic=GeospatialAnalysisReport` to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the crew and `uv run pytest`.

-   [x] **Phase 7: Refactor `HRIntelligenceCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure `hr_reporter` agent in `agents.yaml` has `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `hr_intelligence_crew.py`, import `HRIntelligenceReport` and add `output_pydantic=HRIntelligenceReport` to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the crew and `uv run pytest`.

-   [x] **Phase 8: Refactor `LegalAnalysisCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure `legal_reporter` agent in `agents.yaml` has `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `legal_analysis_crew.py`, import `LegalAnalysisReport` and add `output_pydantic=LegalAnalysisReport` to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the crew and `uv run pytest`.

-   [x] **Phase 9: Refactor `WebPresenceCrew` and `TechStackCrew` (Corrected)**
    -   [x] **YAML**: Ensure reporter agents in `agents.yaml` for both crews have `tools: []`.
    -   [x] **Python**: In `web_presence_crew.py` and `tech_stack_crew.py`, import the corresponding Pydantic models and add the `output_pydantic` parameter to the final `Task`.
    -   [x] **Verify**: Run the full test suite.

-   [x] **Phase 10: Final Verification**
    -   [x] **Final Regression Test**: After all refactoring is complete, run the full test suite one last time: `uv run pytest`.

* [x] **Refactor Logging to use Loguru**
  * [x] Add `loguru` to `pyproject.toml`.
  * [x] Replace the standard `logging` module with `loguru` across the application.
  * [x] Configure `loguru` sinks for console and file logging.
  * [x] Update the development guide with the new logging standards.

### 2. Remove Redundant `bin` Scripts

* [ ] **Issue:** The `src/epic_news/bin` directory contains several debug and analysis scripts (`analyze_library_crew.py`, `debug_holiday_plan_html.py`, etc.). These are useful for development but add clutter to the `src` directory.
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  * [ ] **Move Scripts to a `scripts` Directory:** Relocate these helper scripts to a top-level `scripts/` directory to separate them from the core application source code.
  * [ ] **Improve Script Quality:** Ensure scripts follow the same coding standards as the main application (e.g., use `loguru`, `pathlib`).
* [ ] **Files:** `src/epic_news/bin/`

### 3. Standardize Logging

* [ ] **Issue:** The `app.py` (Streamlit UI) uses the standard `logging` module, while the rest of the application is meant to use `loguru` as per the development guide.
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  * [ ] **Replace `logging` with `loguru` in `app.py`:** Refactor `app.py` to use `loguru` for all logging, consistent with the rest of the project. The `QueueLogger` can be adapted for `loguru`.
* [ ] **File:** `src/epic_news/app.py`

### 5. Refactor `ContentState` Model

* [ ] **Issue:** The `ContentState` model in `src/epic_news/models/content_state.py` has a large number of `Union[Any, None]` fields for crew results. This is not type-safe and makes it hard to understand the expected data structure for each crew.
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  * [ ] **Use Specific Pydantic Models:** For each crew result field (e.g., `company_profile`, `tech_stack`), use the specific Pydantic model that the crew is expected to return (e.g., `CompanyProfile`, `TechStackReport`). This will improve type safety and clarity.
* [ ] **File:** `src/epic_news/models/content_state.py`

### 6. Standardize Pydantic Optional Fields

* [ ] **Issue:** The use of `Union[X, None]` and `Optional[X]` for optional fields is inconsistent across the Pydantic models.
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  * [ ] **Standardize on `Optional[X]`:** Refactor all optional fields in Pydantic models to use `from typing import Optional` and `Optional[X]`. This is functionally identical to `Union[X, None]` but is more explicit and idiomatic for declaring optional fields.
  * [ ] **Strictly Avoid `|`:** This refactoring will be done while strictly adhering to the project rule of **never** using the `|` operator for unions (e.g., `str | None`), which is incompatible with CrewAI.
* [ ] **Files:** `src/epic_news/models/`

  * [ ] Test the API integrations to ensure they function correctly within the project.
  * [ ] Document the API usage and any configuration steps for future reference.

### 4. Remove Unused and Deprecated Code

* [ ] **Issue:** There are several commented-out code blocks and unused imports across various files (e.g., `company_news_crew.py` has a commented-out `fact_checker` agent).
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  * [ ] **Perform a Code Cleanup:** Systematically review all files in `src/` and remove dead code, commented-out blocks, and unused imports. This improves readability and reduces maintenance overhead.
* [ ] **Files:**
  * `src/epic_news/crews/company_news/company_news_crew.py`
  * ... and others.

<!-- ### 1. Eliminate `utils/html` in Favor of Deterministic Rendering

* [ ] **Issue:** The `utils/html` directory contains numerous `*_html_factory.py` files that manually construct HTML. This is brittle and inconsistent with the "Deterministic Python-Based Rendering" pattern described in the architecture guide, which favors `TemplateManager`.
* [ ] **Recommendation:**
  - [ ] **Delete `utils/html`:** Remove the entire `src/epic_news/utils/html` directory.
  - [ ] **Refactor to Use `TemplateManager`:** Modify all crew handlers in `main.py` to pass the Pydantic model output directly to `TemplateManager` for rendering, as demonstrated by the `saint_to_html` example in the documentation. This ensures all HTML generation is centralized and consistent.
* [ ] **Files:**
  * `src/epic_news/utils/html/` (delete entire directory)
  * `src/epic_news/main.py` (update all `generate_*` methods) -->
